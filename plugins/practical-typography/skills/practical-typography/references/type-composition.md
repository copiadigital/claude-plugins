# Type Composition Reference

Detailed rules for characters, punctuation, spacing, and special symbols.

## Quotes & Apostrophes

### Curly (Smart) Quotes
- Always use curly quotes in professional documents: ' ' " "
- Straight quotes (' ") are a typewriter-era artefact
- Most word processors have a "smart quotes" setting — enable it
- The only legitimate use for straight marks is foot (′) and inch (″) notation, and code

### Apostrophes
- Must be curly and point downward: it's, don't, '90s
- Common error: leading apostrophes often render as opening single quotes (pointing the wrong way)
- Verify manually in cases like '90s or 'twas

## Dashes

### Hyphen (-)
Three uses:
1. **Line breaks** — automatic word breaking between lines
2. **Compound words** — e.g. "topsy-turvy", "cost-effective"
3. **Phrasal adjectives** — "high-school grades", "five-dollar bills"

Exceptions:
- No hyphen after -ly adverbs: "closely held company"
- No hyphen after most prefixes: "nonprofit", "coauthor"
- No hyphen in foreign proper names used as adjectives

### En Dash (–)
Two uses:
1. **Ranges** — 1880–1912, pages 330–39, $500–$600. When using "from", pair with "to" instead ("from 1880 to 1912", not "from 1880–1912")
2. **Connections/contrasts** — "conservative–liberal split", "Sarbanes–Oxley Act", "London–Paris flight"

### Em Dash (—)
- Use when a comma is too weak but a colon, semicolon, or parentheses are too strong
- Creates a pause or break between parts of a sentence
- Set flush against surrounding text (no spaces), though spaces are acceptable on screen
- Underused in professional writing — prefer it to overusing commas and parentheses
- Never approximate with double hyphens (--)

## Spaces

### One Space Between Sentences
- Always one space after a full stop, never two
- The two-space convention is a typewriter habit with no place in professional typography

### Word Spaces
- Never use multiple consecutive spaces for alignment — use tabs or indents
- Avoid consecutive white-space characters of any kind

### Nonbreaking Spaces
- Place after paragraph marks (¶) and section marks (§) to prevent the mark from being stranded at the end of a line
- Also useful between numbers and units (e.g. 5 kg) and in other places where a line break would be confusing

## Punctuation

### Ellipsis
- Use the proper ellipsis character (…), not three periods with spaces
- Insert as a single character in your document

### Exclamation Marks
- Limit to one per document exceeding three pages
- Overuse dilutes their impact

### Ampersands (&)
- Use sparingly in running text
- Acceptable in proper names (e.g. "Johnson & Johnson") and informal contexts

### Semicolons & Colons
- Use as normal English punctuation — no special typographic treatment needed beyond ensuring proper spacing

## Special Characters

### Trademark & Copyright Symbols
- Use proper characters: ™ © ®
- Do not approximate with letter combinations like (c) or (tm)

### Accented Characters
- Always use proper accented forms: résumé, naïve, café, piñata
- Available via keyboard shortcuts or character insertion in all modern systems

### Foot & Inch Marks
- Use straight/prime marks (′ ″), not curly quotes
- This is the one case where straight marks are correct

### Math Symbols
- Use proper multiplication (×), minus (−), and other symbols rather than letter approximations

### Ligatures
- Enable OpenType ligatures where available (fi, fl, ffi, ffl)
- Most modern professional fonts include them; most layout software supports them
