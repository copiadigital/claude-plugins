# Text Formatting Reference

Detailed guidance on styling, emphasis, fonts, colour, and visual treatment of text.

## Emphasis: Bold & Italic

### Core Rules
- **Mutually exclusive** — use bold OR italic, never both on the same text
- **Use sparingly** — emphasis only works when it's rare; overuse makes text harder to read and diminishes impact
- **No stacking** — never underline bold text or add other redundant emphasis

### By Font Type
- **Serif fonts** — use italic for gentle emphasis; bold for stronger emphasis
- **Sans-serif fonts** — use bold only; sans-serif italics often lack sufficient visual distinction from the roman weight

### When to Use
- Key terms on first introduction
- Titles of works (books, films — italic)
- Technical terms or foreign words (italic)
- UI labels or important warnings (bold)
- Never for entire paragraphs or large blocks of text

## Underlining
- Never underline text in professional documents
- Underlining is a typewriter-era convention for requesting italic from a typesetter
- The only acceptable use is for hyperlinks on the web, and even then it's a convention, not a requirement

## Capitalisation

### ALL CAPS
- Acceptable for short text under one line (headings, labels, acronyms)
- Never for body text or long passages — reduces readability
- **Always add 5–12% extra letterspacing** to improve legibility

### Small Caps
- Only use if genuine small-cap glyphs are available in the font (not fake small caps generated by the software)
- **Always add 5–12% extra letterspacing**
- Good for abbreviations (AM/PM), acronyms in running text, and subheadings

## Letterspacing & Kerning

### Letterspacing (Tracking)
- Add 5–12% extra letterspacing for ALL CAPS and small caps
- Tight letterspacing is rarely appropriate for body text
- Headings may benefit from slight tracking adjustments depending on the font

### Kerning
- Always enable kerning in your document or CSS (`font-kerning: normal` or `letter-spacing` adjustments)
- Kerning adjusts spacing between specific letter pairs (e.g. AV, To, WA) for even visual rhythm
- Professional fonts include kerning tables; enable them

## Font Selection

### What to Avoid
- **System defaults** — Times New Roman, Arial, Calibri, Cambria
- **Goofy fonts** — Comic Sans, Papyrus, Curlz, and similar decorative fonts
- **Monospaced fonts** — Only for code; never for body text
- **Most free fonts** — Often lack complete character sets, proper kerning, or multiple weights

### What to Choose
- Professional fonts from reputable foundries
- Fonts with a full family: regular, italic, bold, bold italic at minimum
- Fonts with proper small caps, old-style figures, and ligatures for best results

### Mixing Fonts
- **One font is often enough** — vary weight, size, and style for hierarchy
- **Two fonts maximum** in most documents
- **Three is risky; four or more is almost always too many**
- Assign each font a consistent, distinct role (body vs headings)
- Keep fonts in separate paragraphs — don't mix within a paragraph
- Fonts by the same designer tend to pair well
- Contrast between fonts can come from any axis (serif/sans, light/heavy, wide/narrow) — not just serif vs sans

## Colour

### In Print
- Body text must always be black — no exceptions
- Colour is ineffective for emphasis at body-text sizes (too little surface area)
- Avoid knockout type (white on dark) in laser-printed documents — uses excessive toner
- In professional printing, multiple shades of one colour work better than contrasting colours

### On Screen
- Consider dark grey (#333 or similar) instead of pure black for body text — screens project light, so pure black creates harsh contrast
- Colour is the standard way to indicate clickable links — use it freely for hyperlinks
- Be careful using colour on non-clickable text — readers may assume it's a link
- Less colour is more effective

### In PDFs
- Follow print rules if the PDF will be printed
- Follow screen rules if it's screen-only
- Avoid dark grey body text in PDFs destined for printing — appears gritty

### General Principles
- Light–dark contrast draws the eye most powerfully
- Perceived colour intensity varies with font size, weight, and hue
- Coloured type on coloured backgrounds is almost always a poor choice
- When everything is emphasised, nothing is emphasised

## Headings

### Sizing
- Headings should be distinct from body text but not excessively large
- A heading 2–3 points larger than body text, set in bold or a contrasting font, is often sufficient
- Giant headings waste space and look amateurish

### Hierarchy
- Create clear visual levels: H1, H2, H3
- Each level should be visually distinct but part of a coherent system
- Use consistent formatting for each level throughout the document
- Heading hierarchy can be achieved through combinations of size, weight, caps, and font changes

## Alternate Figures

### Old-Style (Lowercase) Figures
- Blend into body text better than lining (uppercase) figures
- Characters like 3, 4, 7 have descenders; 6, 8 have ascenders
- Preferred in professional body text when available

### Lining (Uppercase) Figures
- All sit on the baseline at a uniform height
- Better for tables, all-caps text, and headings

### Tabular vs Proportional
- Tabular figures have uniform width — use in tables and columns of numbers
- Proportional figures have varying width — use in running text
