# Citation & Authority Building

## Concept Ownership Strategy

### Finding Frontier Concepts
Identify topics where your organisation can be the first or most definitive source:

1. **Monitor emerging discussions** — Track Twitter/X, Reddit, GitHub, Discord, and forums for questions that lack authoritative answers
2. **Identify competitor gaps** — Find topics where existing coverage is shallow, outdated, or insufficient
3. **Align with strengths** — Choose concepts that intersect with your organisation's unique expertise, data, or experience
4. **Apply the competitor replication test** — If a competitor could copy the content tomorrow and match it, dig deeper. Share original data, benchmarks, customer stories, or insights they cannot easily replicate.

### Building Depth
- Include metrics, code blocks, tables, lists, quotes, and diagrams
- Share original research, internal benchmarks, or proprietary data
- Provide worked examples with real numbers, not hypotheticals
- Create topic clusters with internal linking to reinforce concept relationships

### Terminology Consistency
- Use precise, consistent language throughout all content
- Avoid fuzzy synonyms that weaken semantic embeddings
- Establish clear concept definitions and use them uniformly
- Create a terminology guide for content authors

## Organic Citation Strategy

### High-Signal Channels
Focus presence and engagement on channels that carry weight in training data and RAG indices:

| Channel | Best For |
|---|---|
| Reddit | Community discussions, AMAs, authentic recommendations |
| GitHub | Open-source projects, technical documentation, issue discussions |
| Hacker News | Technical thought leadership, product launches |
| Twitter/X | Real-time engagement, thread-based explanations |
| LinkedIn | Professional insights, industry analysis |
| Stack Overflow | Technical Q&A, canonical answers |

### Earning Citations
- Share content in threads, AMAs, changelogs, and product demos
- Create open-source resources, tools, or datasets others can reference
- Provide real examples and reproducible code in community discussions
- Write canonical answers to frequently asked questions
- Contribute to documentation and wikis in your domain

### What to Avoid
- Paid links — organic citations carry significantly more weight in training data
- Link farms or artificial citation networks
- Spammy self-promotion in forums
- Keyword stuffing or SEO-first content that lacks substance
