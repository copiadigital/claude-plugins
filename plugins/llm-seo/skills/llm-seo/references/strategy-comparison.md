# Traditional SEO vs LLM SEO Comparison

## Side-by-Side Comparison

| Traditional SEO | LLM/AI SEO | Both Required |
|---|---|---|
| Backlinks | Embedding-based relevance | Crawlable, indexable pages |
| Keyword volume | Natural-language query interpretation | Clear heading hierarchy |
| SERP rankings | RAG index visibility | Fresh, updated content |
| Anchor text optimisation | Concept clarity and ownership | Schema markup |
| Meta descriptions | Self-contained, extractable snippets | Internal linking |
| Link equity | Community mentions (GitHub, Reddit) | Fast, static HTML/CSS |
| CTR optimisation | Semantic depth and originality | High-intent, decision-stage content |

## Key Mindset Shifts

### From Keywords to Concepts
Traditional SEO targets specific keyword phrases and their variations. LLM SEO targets **concept ownership** — becoming the definitive source for a topic so that models reference your content when answering related queries.

### From Rankings to Retrieval
Instead of optimising for position on a search results page, optimise for **inclusion in model context windows**. Content must be structured so retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems can extract and cite it.

### From Backlinks to Community Signal
While backlinks still matter for traditional search, LLMs weigh **organic community mentions** — discussions on Reddit, GitHub issues, Hacker News threads, Stack Overflow answers, and Twitter/X posts that reference your content.

### From Click-Through to Citation
Success shifts from driving clicks to **being cited inline** in AI-generated responses. Content must be self-contained enough that a model can extract a useful snippet without requiring the reader to visit the source.

## Content Refresh Cadence

| Interval | Action |
|---|---|
| 30 days | Review new content performance, fix broken links |
| 90 days | Update underperforming pages, expand successful content |
| 180 days | Archive outdated pages with redirects, audit full content catalogue |

Models re-crawl the web regularly. Stale content loses retrieval potential over time. Always update `lastmod` timestamps when refreshing content.

## Measurement Approaches

### Citation Visibility
- Search your domain in Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Claude
- Document where and how sources are cited inline

### Traffic Attribution
- Track referrers from chat.openai.com, perplexity.ai, bard.google.com, claude.ai in analytics
- Monitor for repeated phrasing across AI-generated content (suggests influence)
- Watch community forums, social media, and blogs for natural mentions

### Index Monitoring
- Track indexing coverage in Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools
- Monitor rankings for key concepts
- Use tools like Ahrefs, Mention, or Semrush for mention tracking
